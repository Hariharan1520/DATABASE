P(R) represents a pattern drawn by Julia in R rows. The following pattern represents P(5):

* 
* * 
* * * 
* * * * 
* * * * *



Write a query to print the pattern P(20).
WITH RECURSIVE PATTERN(ROW_NUM, STARS) AS (
    SELECT 1 AS ROW_NUM, CAST(REPEAT('* ', 1)AS CHAR(100)) STARS
    UNION ALL
    SELECT ROW_NUM + 1, CAST(REPEAT('* ', ROW_NUM + 1) AS CHAR(100))
    FROM PATTERN
    WHERE ROW_NUM < 20
)
SELECT STARS
FROM PATTERN;
